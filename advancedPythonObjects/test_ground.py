'''
always test your assumptions know how things are working so u can explain it to people
e.g we learnt about self 
is that what you expected then if there is a mismatch we probe further
'''

# def run(self): add this to a class to know about self
#     return self


# encapsulation - its the binding of data and functions that manipulates that data into one object so that we keep everything in this box so that users or code or other machine can interact with them

# e.g. we have functions that act on our class and also the class constains data  giving us more control and functionality and allow us mimic real world


# abstraction
# hiding info and giving access to only what is necessary
# e.g player1.run() #we dont see how it working we only get the results we dont get access to everything the same is for built in function

len('fdfsf')  # we dont need to know how the len works intenally all we need to know is it returns the length of the parameter given to it
