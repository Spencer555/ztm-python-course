'''
machine learning is give a list of input and expected output  to trian me and give me a new output and let the machine figure out what the function is the word function can be replaced with the word model it receives an input
'''

# categories u mostly see
# supervised learning
# data with labels e.g csv with coloum names
# classification
# regresssion

# unsupervised learning
# data without label e.g csv without coloum name
# clustering
# association rule learning

# reinforcements
# teaching through trial and error reward and punishment
# skill acquision
# real time learning

# what a machine learnig expert do
# 1 machine learning firstthing we do is import the data

# 2 clean the data

# 3 split the data
# e.g we have a 100 excel rows and we make 80 our training set the remaining 20 rows are our test set becaue we have to tell the machine if it got the answer right or wrong


# 4 create a model
# import the algo u want to use


# 5 check the output

# 6 improve

tools 

numpy 
a library that help us use list and arrays in python specifically multidimensional array used often

pandas
used for data analysis it gives us an idea of the data frame which allows the functionality to manipulate data in tabular structure with row and cols e.g reading a csv file it extract data to data frame 


scikit-learn 
it for creating a model it comes pre build with classification,regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection ,preprocessing

7.04

matplotlib
a charting library it allows us to visualize data in a nice way


jupyter notebook 
used for code  for ml it very critical and standard for ml


data
data to work with 
kaggle - helps us with data sets to use


'''


'''
custom models - models u create by ur self 

retriainable models - models already created 

pretrained models - plug and play models u can use they are already made for you

# the value is not the model but the data we use in creating the model
